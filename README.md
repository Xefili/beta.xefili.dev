# Welcome to the beta repo!

This repo is special, it will be used to supply content for beta.xefili.dev and will contain the latest project I'm working on. If a project makes it into this repository, it may be close to production ready. Do not use this repo for commit or version tracking!

## Current project:

### Documentation

The documentation is finished. The repository will therefore be migrated soon. Until migration is completed, no further commits or pull requests are allowed.
